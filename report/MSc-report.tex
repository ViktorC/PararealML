% This example file shows how a report can be laid out using Latex. It
% does not use any special local features so should be portable to other
% places.
% 
% When producing draft copies of a thesis you may want to print only
% selected pages of the thesis. To do this use the command
% 
% dvips -f -p 4 -n 3 myfile.dvi | lpr
% 
% where -p 4 means start printing at page 4 (ie the page that will be
% numbered 4, not necessarily the 4th page) and -n 3 means print 3 pages.
% This example will print pages 4, 5 and 6.
% 
% If you want to print the report and also save paper you can print more
% than one page on each sheet of paper. Use the command
% 
% dvips -f myfile.dvi | psnup -2 | lpr
% 
% to print 2 pages per sheet. psnup can take values 2, 4, 8, or 9.
%
% To produce a PDF version you can create a PostScript copy first
%
% dvips -f myfile.dvi > myfile.pdf
%
% and then convert it
%
% distill myfile.ps
%
% or you can go straight to PDF
%
% pdflatex myfile
%
% Note that pdflatex expects all included figures to be in PDF too. See
% the includegraphics command below.


% This document contains many cross-references and forward references,
% eg in constructing a table of contents, so Latex may need to be run
% twice to get all the references correct. If you need to run Latex twice
% you may get the warning:
% 
% LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

This template is a slightly modified version of the one developed by
Prof. Charles Duncan for MSc students in the Dept. of Meteorology. His
acknowledgement follows:

{\em This template has been produced with help from many former students who
have shown different ways of doing things. Please make suggestions for
further improvements.}

\section*{Note}

This template was originally created for a full MSc dissertation.
Although I have modified the format slightly (eg there are no separate
chapters), I have not substantially changed the text or the advice
appearing in the \LaTeX comments (source lines beginning with \%). You
should therefore be aware that for a shorter report you may
not need to go into as much detail as indicated here. For example, you
might not need to include any acknowledgements and any reference list is
likely to be very short.

\section{Introduction}

This should contain a description of your project and the problem you
are trying to solve. Where appropriate you should also include
references to work which has already been done on your topic and
anything else which lets you set your work in context.

One of the things you will need to do is to ensure that you have a
suitable list of references.  To do this you should see \cite{ref:lam}
or some other suitable reference.  Note the format of the citation used
here is the style favoured in this department.  Here is another
reference \cite{ref:bloggs} for good measure.

You will also want to make sure you have no spelling or grammatical
mistakes. To help idwentify spelling mistukes you caan use the commands
{\em ispell} or {\em spell}. See the appropriate manual pages. Remember
that spelling mistakes are not the only errors which can occur. Spelling
checkers will not find errors which are, in fact, valid words such as
{\em there} for {\em their}, nor will they find repeated words which
sometimes occur if your concentration is broken when typing. {\bf There
is no substitute for thorough proof reading!}

\section{Previous Dissertation Review}

In the introductory paragraph, clearly identify the reviewed dissertation by its Title, Author and Year.

\subsection*{Summarize the project in your own words.}

This is just to show how to break things into sections.

Here is a padding paragraph.  Rhubarb.  More rhubarb.  Yet more rhubarb.

\subsection*{Does the dissertation adequately explain the context in which the problem is set?}

Give evidence to support your answer based on the quality of motivation, background and previous work overview.

\subsection*{Has the student adequately explained the scope of the problem, the approach that they would take, how success would be measured and reflected on the outcomes?}

Consider limitations, reproducibility and research methods used. Give evidence to support your answer. 

\subsection*{Quality of presentation.}
Comment on the overall structure, whether the explanations were clear and easy to follow, how was the language used. 

\subsection*{Presentation of additional information.}
Discus the use of references and citations throughout the text and use of figures and tables (their design, placement and descriptions, references to from within text, etc.)

\section{Background and Literature Review}

I created a figure which is centred and stretched to 30\% of the
width of the page \verb+{0.30\hsize}+ and with the height stretched by
the same amount \verb+{!}+ to preserve the aspect ratio. If you omit the
extension (ie .eps, .ps or .pdf) on the file name then \LaTeX  will pick
up the postscript copy whereas pdflatex will automatically pick up the
PDF version.


\begin{figure}

\begin{center}
\resizebox{0.30\hsize}{!}{\includegraphics{logos/crest_bw}}
\end{center}

\caption{The University Crest}
\label{fig:eucrest}

\end{figure}


% see the man page for dvips for details of the special command which is
% much more powerful than is shown here. It allows offsets in the
% horizontal and vertical and scaling in x and y.

% choosing suitable values for offset and scale can be a tiring matter
% of trial and error.

% note that labels do not need to include a description of the object
% they are labelling but it can be helpful, eg \label{fig:figurename}.

You can use a label on a figure to refer to it later: The university
crest is in Figure~\ref{fig:eucrest}. Note that you should not use phrases like
``the figure above'' or ``the following figure'' since \LaTeX  may move
the figure relative to the text if it cannot be fitted onto the current page.


\section{Preliminary Investigations}

You might want to include an equation here:

\begin{equation} \delta N_{\nu} = (\delta N_{\nu})_{ex} + (\delta N_{\nu})_{au} 
\label{equation:delsplit}
% note that the label is optional but allows you to refer to this
% equation later.
\end{equation}

You might sometimes want to include equations without numbering them.

\begin{displaymath}
E=mc^{2}
\end{displaymath}

You might also want to include diagrams.  The example shows the use of
the special command which allows existing postscript files to be
included.  You would normally keep your figures separate from the text. 
These pictures might be satellite images or postscript output from some
program such as IDL, PV-WAVE, Uniras or xpaint.

\paragraph{More on numbering:}

This text is in a paragraph which is also not numbered by default and
the ``title'' of the paragraph is not on a separate line.
If you want to increase the depth to which subsections are numbered you
should see the subsection on setting the secnumdepth counter in the manual. 


\section{Final Proposal}

One way to produce simple graphs is to use gnuplot which can produce
native \LaTeX  output. Graph \ref{fig:gnu} was produced using gnuplot with
output designated as \LaTeX; this creates a \LaTeX output file which you
can include directly or keep separate and refer to using the {\em
include} command.

Another approach is to draw simple figures using {\em xfig} which allows
you to export diagrams in \LaTeX picture format so that the diagram can
be included directly.

Perhaps the most robust way to include graphs is to create then using
whatever package you like (eg Excel) and then convert them to PostScript
or PDF and include them in the same was as was done in
Figure~\ref{fig:eucrest} for the University Crest. You can usually do
this with most packages, including Microsoft ones. One trick for
producing PostScript is to print to a dummy PostScript printer; for PDF
you can use the free CutePDF utilities at {\verb+www.cutepdf.com+}.

% in practice you would probably keep this in a separate file and use
% the \include{filename} command to insert it here.

\section{Workplan}

You are likely to use tables and graphs. You can create tables easily in \LaTeX.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l|c|l }
\toprule
{\bf File names} & {\bf Satellite} & {\bf Resolution}\\
\midrule
  worldr         &  Meteosat     &   5km\\
  worldg         &  Meteosat     &   5km\\
  worldb         &  Meteosat     &   5km\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{This is a simple table. More complicated tables can have
headings which pass over more than one column}
\label{simple_table}
\end{table}

If you want to produce fancier tables than shown in Table \ref{simple_table}
refer to the manual.

\section{Outline of the Dissertation Report}

You will probably need a numbered list here, which is rather simple in \LaTeX:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item This is top level rhubarb.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 2nd level
		\item some rhubarb
		\item and more
	\end{enumerate}
	\item More top level rhubarb
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item other boring vegetables 
		\item kale, for example
	\end{enumerate}
	\item And so on
\end{enumerate}
